### Document Purpose

This document, mainly intended to the **Project Manager** and the **Software Engineers**.<br>
Its content aims to detail and explain all the technical aspects of the projects. <br>
The question to answer is "**How to implement, technically, the decisions specified in the Functional Specification document ?**"<br>
The **Software Engineers** should find in it, all the implementation processes, conventions, choices and explanations required in order to deliver a structured, optimized, readable, and stable code.

### Overview

This student project, given by [ALGOSUP](https://github.com/algosup), is about coding the game *Frogger*^[1], using a *Go Board*^[2], with the language *Verilog*^[3]. All the requirements as well as the game design and logic are detailed in the [Functional Specification](https://github.com/algosup/2024-2025-project-1-fpga-team-7/blob/main/documents/Functional_specification/functional_specification.md) of the project.
