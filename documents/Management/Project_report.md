## Overview üîé

This document is the final report of the project. It will summarize the project's development, the problems faced, the solutions found, and the final version of the project.

The project's development started on the 23rd of September 2024 and ended on the 21st of October 2024. The project's presentation was done on the 25st of October 2024.

## Work Done üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

During these five weeks, every aspects of the `Frogger Game` that our team designed were implemented.

Even if the project seemed simple at first, each member of the team faced different challenges that were overcome with the help of the other team members.

The game was built piece by piece, starting with the game's logic, including the frog's movements, the cars' movements, and the game's rules. Then, the game's graphics were implemented, including the frog's sprite, the cars' sprites, and the game's background.

The game's final version was completed on time, and the team was able to test the game and fix the bugs that were found after the testing.

## Timelines & Targets üìÖ

The team was able to follow every timeline and target that was defined in the project planning. The project's final version was completed on time and the project's presentation was done on the 25st of October 2024.

The main deadlines that were followed and there state are:

## Problems Faced üõ†Ô∏è

During the project, the team faced some problems that were solved with the help of the team members. The main problems faced were:

### Memory Usage Overload

#### Overview

This problem was persistent over the project's duration. The development team noticed that while launching the program from a windows machine, the memory usage was far greater than when launching the program from a mac machine.

#### Status

As the development team was able to organize themselves in a way that they could always run the program using a MacOs machine, the problem was not a priority. The final decision was to leave this problem for the future, in a case where a specific need of running the program in a windows machine arises.

### Absence of a Team Members

#### Overview

During the project, some team members were absent for a few days. This caused some delays in the project's development. Most of the time, the absent members were able to contact the team in order to organize the work and to catch up with the project's development.

#### Status

The team was able to organize themselves in a way that the absent members could catch up with the project's development. As the absent members were able to contact the team, the management adapted to them and the project's development was not delayed.

### Use of RAM (Random Access Memory)

#### Overview

The development team noticed that the game needed a lot of storage space in the board's memory. As the board was very limited in the term of memory, the team had to find a way to reduce the game's memory usage or to find a way to have more memory available.

#### Status

The team was able to reduce the game's memory usage by optimizing the game's code. The team also found a way to have more memory available by using a Block RAM in addition to the board's memory.

That allowed the game to have more space in the memory and to run smoothly on the board.

## Conclusion üìù

Even if the process was not completely smooth, the team was able to develop the project's final version on time. The final version contains everything that the team planned to implement in the project.

The team was able to follow the project's planning and to complete the project's final version on time. The project's presentation was done on the 25st of October 2024 and the team was able to present the project to the stakeholders.

The project's final version is available in the project's repository and can be accessed by the stakeholders and anyone who wants to test the game.
