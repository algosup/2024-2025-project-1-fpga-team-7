## Problems Faced

### Memory Usage Overload

#### Overview

This problem is persistent over the last weeks. To remind, the development team noticed that while launching the program from a windows machine, the memory usage was far greater than when launching the program from a mac machine.

#### Status

As the development team was able to organize themselves in a way that they could always run the program using a MacOs machine, the problem was not a priority. The final decision was to leave this problem for the future, in a case where a specific need of running the program in a windows machine arises.



## Uncompleted Tasks

This table is designed based on the tasks defined in the [Project_planning.md](../Project_planning.md). The tasks that were not completed in the week are listed below (note that some tasks may not be meant to be completed in the week):

## Next Week's Plan

For the next week, the focus should be on the project's presentation that the team will have to present to the stakeholders. If any bug is found after the deadline, the development team will try to fix it before the presentation.

A document containing the project's report will also be created and should contain all the information about the project's development. The document should be ready before the presentation.
