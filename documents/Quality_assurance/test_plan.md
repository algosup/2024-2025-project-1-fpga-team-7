## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to outline the testing strategy aimed at ensuring the functionality, quality, and performance of the Frogger game, developed for the FPGA module. 

The test plan covers a broad range of scenarios, including hardware, software, and user interface components. Our primary objective is to verify that the game meets the defined requirements, operates smoothly under various conditions, and maintains high performance throughout gameplay.

This document will also enumerate the test cases required to cover these areas, detailing both functional and performance tests to ensure the Frogger game performs optimally on the FPGA platform.

## 1.Objectives 

The goal of this project is to program a version of the famous game Frogger: it's a game where we play a frog attempting to cross a road and a river to join his home, and who must avoid certain obstacles like cars while trying to get the highest score possible.

Furthermore, the main difficulty is to program this game for an FPGA module, using the Verilog programming language. Indeed, we will need to program the game while testing it on the FPGA module and checking its performance.

Concerning the game rules:
- The frog must reach the end of the road to go to the next level, where he will be teleported back to its starting location. The player gets points after each level passed.
- The player must use the different switch buttons from the FPGA module to progress through the game: Left, Right, Up and Down.
- The player must avoid the moving car which came from the right and the left, while crossing through the different lanes.
- At each level, the difficulty will increase with the acceleration of the moving cars.
- If the player collides with a car, it will trigger a death and he will be teleported back to level 1 at the starting point.
- After a death, the game will be frozen and the player will need to push all 4 buttons simultaneously to restart the game.

The project must be completed for October 21th 2024.

## 2.Testing Strategy
The test cases will be separated in 6 different domain of testing. Indeed, we want to check each type individually to ensure their performance before testing the cases together.

### 2.1.Functional Testing
Probably the most important, this first type of testing concerns the game logic: its goal is to ensure the game's functions work correctly, such as the player movements, the collisions and the reset conditions.

The testing will be executed by the Q.A., with the possible assistance of the Software Engineers and the Program Manager. In fact, the test cases will be accomplished in a way the tester is currently playing the game.

### 2.2.Performance Testing
This testing deals about the clock timing, where the game logic follows the clock cycle allowed by the FPGA module. Furthermore, it will allow to measure the latency and the refresh rate of the game.

The Q.A. and the Tech Lead will be the involved testers, where various softwares and tools would be required to measure the performance. In reality, the goal will be to test the game by monitoring the player's actions and the game's responses.

### 2.3.Stress Testing
Stress Testing is particular, because it involves inconsistent conditions such as simulating multiple inputs or slow loading conditions.

The Q.A., possibly accompanied by the Software Engineers and the Tech Lead, will work on that type of testing. For that, they will pretend to play the game in an "agressive manner" and use a software to simulate a slow latency.

### 2.4.Hardware Testing
This one will be required because it's focused on the use of the FPGA module. Indeed, we will have to make sure the module will handle the required program of the game, that its components like switches and lead still work, and potentially display the level number on his LCD screen.

The Q.A. will work on that testing with the assistance of the Tech Lead, where they will test various programs to ensure the hardware performance of the FPGA module.

### 2.5.User Interface Testing
User Interface Testing, as its name implies, deals with the interaction between the user and the game's interface. Indeed, it will test if the games responds well to the player's inputs and if the game's screen displays correctly on a monitor or another device.

Once again, the Q.A. will be in charge of the test, but with the possible assistance of the Software Engineers and the Program Manager. For that, they will execute various inputs with the keyboard and monitor differents screen settings to visualize the game.

### 2.6.Regression Testing
Finally, Regression Testing should be done after one or several others types of testing have been tested. Indeed, bugs will potentially appear, and after fixing them, there is a huge chance we will have to execute the previous test cases again to ensure their functionnality.

Every involved testers from previous testings, led by the Q.A., will be in charge with the previous rules decided for each testing.

### 3.6.Regression Testing

Throughout the project, we will update the game many times, and the program will be different at each use. So new problems due to the update could occur, even influencing some test cases that have been declared completed.

That's the reason we will perform bunches of testing between each update, and attempt to fix the bugs encountered after new updates.

| Bunch of testing | Date of testing | Number of tests performed |  Number of bugs found (including the tests already completed)    |    Number of tests completed|  
| --------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |    ---------------     |    --------    |
| Bunch of testing nÂ°1 | TBD  |  TBD   | TBD  | TBD  |
| Bunch of testing nÂ°2 | TBD  |  TBD   | TBD  | TBD  |
| Bunch of testing nÂ°3 | TBD  |  TBD   | TBD  | TBD  |
| Bunch of testing nÂ°4 | TBD  |  TBD   | TBD  | TBD  |
| Bunch of testing nÂ°5 | TBD  |  TBD   | TBD  | TBD  |

## 4.Features to not test

Because the time granted of our project will be limited, we have no choice but to put aside some features. 

Indeed, only the 1st part of Frogger, the road, will be present to our version of the game. So any game elements related to the River zone will be ommitted, such as: 

- the floating bushes, and other moving platforms, which would allow the frog to reach the end of the level.
- the possibility to drown, if the frog misses a moving platforms, which will result to a death.
- bonuses to receive points, like a female frog hoping on the character's back, won't be present in our version.

Furthermore, we have decided to avoid to work on these features: 

- a life counter, which will display on screen the number of remaining lives, won't be added because the game will only have 1 life.
- no sound nor music will be added, because they would be hard to program and consume too much memory.
- there won't be any menu and neither a high score chart, as the game starts immediately when the program starts.
- a Game Over screen has been considered, but it won't be added.

## 5.Hardware Requirements

Since this project is programmed exclusively for the FPGA module, we will require specific hardware to upload and execute the code effectively.

First, a Go Board is essential. This board includes a USB port for connecting to a device, four switches for player movement control, two 7-segment displays to show the level counter, and a VGA connector to output the game on a computer screen. Additionally, it incorporates an FPGA chip, which is necessary for utilizing LUTs (Look-Up Tables) and Flip-Flops for logic operations.

Next, we will need either a flipbook or mapbook to carry out the project tests. The program should be compatible with both Apple and Microsoft devices to ensure cross-platform functionality.

Finally, a secondary computer will be required to display the game through a full HD VGA screen and establish a connection to the FPGA module.

## 6.Environment Requirements

A robust programming environment is crucial to conducting tests smoothly and efficiently.

To begin, we utilize VS Code for writing the program and GitHub for version control and collaboration within the team.

However, additional software tools are required for specific testing tasks. These include:

- A tool to monitor the game's framerate and overall performance
- A simulator, such as EDA Playground, to facilitate testbench execution and verify the code functionality in a controlled environment.

## 7.Problem Reporting

In case of a bug encountered, here are the following tasks to follow:

- Step 1: Describe the bug, where we examine what kind of issue it causes to our program.

- Step 2: Analyze the bug, where we write down the conditions to perform the bug.

- Step 3: Update the bug list, where we enter the causes and consequences of our bug as well as its history.

- Step 4: Perform a strategy to attempt countering the problem and fix the issue. Help from other people could be required.

- Step 5: Correct the issue, and make sure to test if the problem doesnt occur anymore.

## 8.Risks & Assumptions

| Risks | Assumptions | 
| ------| ----------- | 
| Limited time and ressources for completing test cases | Prioritize what test cases must be completed first.  |
| The game perform some crashes in some situations. | Ensure the FPGA's memory isnt overused.  |
| The VGA screen has trouble displaying some elements of the game. | Certain sprites must be simplified to use less memory as possible.  |
| Buttons may not respond consistently due to hardware bounce issues. | The debounce logic in the code is correctly implemented and tested for all buttons.  |
| Difficulty debugging hardware-specific issues (e.g., slow execution on FPGA but not in simulation). | Simulation matches the FPGA's actual behavior closely, and FPGA tools provide sufficient insight into performance issues.  |
